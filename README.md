In **Abricotine**, you can preview your document directly in the text editor rather than in a side pane.

* Display syntax highlighting for code,
* Show helpers, anchors and hidden characters,
* Copy formated HTML in the clipboard,
* Write in a distraction-free fullscreen view,
* Manage and beautify markdown tables,
